<h2>Internets Own Boy - Response </h2>

<p>After watching "The internets own boy" it made me curios about how powerful and unfair it is when access to knowledge is restricted in some aspects due to money and laws. I am inspired  by Aaron Swartz's passion and integrity to stand up for what is right even if it meant personal cost to his wellbeing. The movie had evoked anger and sadness out of me due to the way the legal system treated him in a  bad way to make an example out of him to send a message rather than serving him justice. The film helped me appreciate open access and digital freedom as Aaron Swartz helped make the internet into what it is today. It also showed that we have much more of an impact than we think we do when we share ideas and knowledge as it is protected. Overall the movie left a big emotional impact on me as it reminds people that anyone can create a change.<p>

<h2>Social Media & The Web- Response</h2>

<p>The reading "A Contract for the Web" and Ted talk on "Filter Bubbles ", Help me become more attentive to how our data can be used without our permission and knowledge for personalization .The "filter bubble" that Eli Praiser talks about is when our systems monitor us on our online activity to influence our algorithms to produce content you want to see and that is tailored to your needs. However this prevents us from seeing new things and different perspectives which is diminishing as it means people will not be able to broaden there views on different topics and discussions. <P>

<P>The use of our data breaks principle 5 as our data is supposed to be private and secure, As our data is being harvested unknowingly it ends up breaking principle 8 as a result as we cant communicate to communities of those that don't share the same opinion but contradict it . If one of these two principles are to succeed  the other one must as well . In order for this to work the people who hold/take our data must be held accountable to provide safety and security to protect people when they are browsing online so that we can communicate with a broad set of communities with those that differ from our own.<P>

<h2>Anatomy of an AI system- Response </h2>

<p>This is an interesting article as it showed me just how different AI is than  how it is actually perceived by the general population as from far away it just seems like code but if you dive deeper you see how it all comes back down to human labor and extraction of earthly materials. This can be confusing as others and myself included see AI as a non physical thing that just works with no consequences to the earth or people themselves.<p>

<p>In this essay it shows how AI is all around us and the contributions that humans have on it without realizing from the production to the final product from the extraction of materials down to the shipping of products. From this knowledge it made me much more aware of the exploitation of natural resources and workers involved in the daily products we consume like Chat Gpt which uses lots of water to run to cool down these machines and the underpaid workers used to produce machines that use AI ,Such as phone companies like Apple underpaying factory workers from underdeveloped countries to reduce business costs. It shows us how much more destructive AI is than we think it is because of how normalized it is today as people use it in their everyday lives for homework or just searching for information in general as seen from googles AI overview.<p>

<p>From reading this article it is clear AI is very much a physical thing with the human labor and extraction that is involved and should be thought as that way to give people a better understanding of it before hand so we can know the implications beforehand and if it is really worth it. <p>

<h2>Should all Archives be Open Access- Response </h2>

<p>After reading this article i can understand the positives and negatives of open access archives. One of Revs points are that while open access to information is a positive it is also negative as well due to the dangers associated with it from an ethical and privacy concern. Open archives may contain personal information which can lead to an increase in personal data being shared online without the consent of the person. The Open archives may lead to ethical problems as well such as misinformation which can skew events which can give people a false event of what happened creating bias and propaganda if written in a way to provoke an certain opinion of any one thing. <P>

<P>In Revs second point he argues that archives that become easily accessible become unreliable and lose authenticity . This is true in some cases as open access can lead to manipulation or false information which takes away power from archives. In my opinion Rev is making a point that open access can strengthen historical accountability and confidence if archives are managed properly and efficiently by getting them fact checked by  credible historians to prevent the spread of misinformation. <P>

<P>In the last point Rev makes the point that open archives doesn't just include files online but questions of stuff such as  infostructure, institutions and values. In other regions like Central Europe it can lead to complications in open access. <P>

 <h2> Joy Buolamwini Ted talk- Response</h2>

<p>After watching Joy Buolamwini's Ted talk " How I'm fighting bias in algorithms" it made me reflect on how algorithm biases show up in our everyday lives and how it can affect those as it can lead to narrow mindsets as you cant see the broader view. This can be seen from her an interesting point she bought up where the facial recognition technology couldn't  recognize her face unless she was wearing a white mask. This is  alarming as this type of technology could be implemented into healthcare, jobs and services and if it doesn't work properly it could create future problems. This shows how  problems can be created if the broader view is not considered when making these types of technology. <P>

<p>Her response to the problem showed me how we can push back against the problems as seen from her when she created the "Algorithm Justice League" to make technology accountable, transparent and inclusive in its database. I appreciate how she highlighted the unneutrally of algorithms as they reflect choices and values through your searches from stuff you liked and disliked creating a very personalized and bias response which leaves you with a narrow view. This Ted talk makes me second guess on the trustworthiness of the things i see everyday in technology and how important diversity is in the voice of technology is if we want to progress and make technology that truly serves. <P>

<h2>Artefact Analysis</h2>

<p>The digital artefact we made for our group project was a podcast to explain our knowledge on "attention economy" and aspects of it. The role i played in this project was researching my lines and the information for them in our script and recording my lines, As well as participating in meetings with my group to figure out what the project was on and the roles we are going to play in it.<p>

<p>For the first line of the script i researched the term attention economy and where it came from which gave me  Herbert A Simon's definition of it being how our attention is seen as a commodity and something valuable. I gathered more info from this article. Mintzer (2020).Paying Attention: The Attention Economy. Accessible at <a> https://econreview.studentorg.berkeley.edu/paying-attention-the-attention-economy/<a>. (Accessed: 28th November 2025). This then let me branch out on my part of the script to figure out what to research and talk about which led me to how attention economy is seen in our everyday lives through social media and apps that are designed to keep us on for as long as possible. <p>

<p>The last role i completed in our project was recording my lines for the podcast where me and my group mate took multiple takes to make sure the audio and language came out as crisp as possible.<p>
